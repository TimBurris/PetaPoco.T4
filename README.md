# PetaPoco.T4
T4 template for generating, from a database, POCOs for PetaPoco 

These are copied from the orginal [PetaPoco Repository](https://github.com/CollaboratingPlatypus/PetaPoco/tree/development/T4Templates) and modified to run in lastest version of Visual Studio 2019.  Previous copy of the T4's required running in debug mode, and then eventually , after VS updates, failed to run completely.  

The changes made were to remove references to ENVDTE, and instead use the built-in fallback of relative paths.
